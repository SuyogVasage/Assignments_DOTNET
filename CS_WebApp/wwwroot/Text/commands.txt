1. download and install git from http://git-scm.com/
2. create a repository on my computer
   -- creating a local repository
   ++ git init
   == creates an empty repository on my computer
   == .git folder is the repository
3. create files/code/images
4. add some files to the staging area
   -- create a new staging area
   ++ git add <file_name> <file_name> <file_name>
   == git, add these files to the staging area 
   == we want these files to be included in the current edition (a commit)
5. we want to see the status of our repository
   ++ git status 
   == each file will marked as new or modified
   == whether the file is in staging or untracked
   == nothing to commit --> all files are in the current commit and no modifications detected
6. add the saved files (files in our staging) to the commit area 
    -- create a new version/commit/edition
    ++ git commit -m "message for the edition"
    == -m --> message 
    == message tells us in short what was changed/added in the repository
    == it adds the files to our commit area and creates a new version
    == the version is assigned an id --> commit id
7. check the commit history
    ++ git log
    == prints the log of our commits
